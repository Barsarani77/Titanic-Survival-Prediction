# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. Leveraging the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle, the goal is to build a classification model that accurately predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, gender, passenger class, and fare.
This Flask app is a simple web interface for your Titanic survival prediction model.
It collects input, processes it, runs the model, and displays the result.
Train a classification model(like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
